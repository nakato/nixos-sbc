# RaspberryPi 4

## Status

I've not put much effort into the RPi4, but it mostly works.  I do not recommend these devices.


If you want to add any "hats" then you're in for a world of pain because that's what RPi's are.

An upstream kernel is in use, so graphics probably don't work very well, I don't know.


FIXME:  Fill this out
